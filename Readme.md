# XP Practices Site 

This projects shows how to create a whole project with BDD. 

We will start with simple stuff and get more complex over time. 
All assets and artifacts created over time will end up in this repo. 

This is not a codejob only. This will contain 

* A Vision 
* Impact Mapping applied
* User Stories 
* Features and Scanarios defined in Gherkin 
* BDD as development style
