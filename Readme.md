# XP Practices Site 

This projects shows how to create a whole project with BDD. 

We will start with simple stuff and get more complex over time. 
All assets and artifacts created over time will end up in this repo. 

This is not a codejob only. This will contain 

* A Vision 
* Impact Mapping applied
* User Stories 
* Features and Scanarios defined in Gherkin 
* BDD as development style

## Features are not User Stories

One of the base ideas behind features is that they are not User Stroies. Stories will go into the bugtracker of github and cucumber features into the repo.
